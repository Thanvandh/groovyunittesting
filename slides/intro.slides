h1. Testing Is Hard

Testing forces you to think about many things

* Application Design
* Expected Behavior
* Dependencies
* Error Handling
* Corner Cases

h1. Java Adds to the Complexity

* Java's ceremony
* Static typing makes it difficult to mock dependencies
* Static and final methods further complicates mocking

h1. Making it Easier

* Author the tests in Groovy
* Use Groovy's dynamic feature to mock dependencies
* Use JMockit to mock static and final methods
